                        In this article, Eleanor Brooks recounts her interview with Dakshnamoarthy Natarajan, a homosexual Indian man, as a means to discuss homosexual identity and gay rights in India. She retells parts of D’s experience in his own words, focusing on his to personal journey to acknowledge his gay identity in a country where homosexuality was both illegal and socially rejected. The piece uses the recent repeal of Section 377 in India’s penal code as a point of inflection to discuss this issue; S377 had originally outlawed homosexuality in India, and while its recent repeal is seen as a jurisprudential win for gay rights, homophobic social norms persist.
